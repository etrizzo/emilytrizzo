                <h3>About Game</h3>
                <p>Adventure is a 2D roguelike, complete with procedurally generated maps, perma-death, a quest system, and a party system. Originally, this project was assigned over 5 weeks in my first software development class at Guildhall. I later decided to take the game further by continuing development over an 8-week directed focus study, and during my own time outside of class. My goal with development was to move beyond the standard roguelike formula, and give the player a sense of growth from quest to quest. I worked to achieve this by developing my map generation system, and modeling gameplay after my favorite arc in the popular Dungeons and Dragons podcast “The Adventure Zone.” The breadth of this project allowed me to explore many areas of interest for me – including procedural generation, AI, UI, and system design - and will continue to be a great project to return to and polish into a finished game.</p>
                <p>
                In adventure, the player spawns into a large map, filled with both friendly and hostile entities. The player must explore the map to complete a main quest, which will bring them to the next encounter. But, the player can spend more time searching to complete side quests, to grant them more equipment, stats, and even new party members. As the player moves through encounters, the maps get progressively harder, with more and more high-level enemies spawning. The player must survive through as many encounters as possible, until their entire party dies out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maps in Adventure are generated through a sequence of generation steps, defined in data. For this system, I implemented a large number of generation step types, which, when used in tandem, can create exciting, organic 2D maps. To expand on this system, I added a masking system, which allowed generation steps to be run on a sub-area of the main map. These subareas can be defined as rectangles, circles, or perlin noise ranges. This system is extremely buildable – I can easily add new generation steps, and quickly see results on the screen.

                <div align="center">

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>It was important to me to add a robust quest system to the game, to really get the feel of an RPG. The game has both main quests and side quests, where completing the main quest will progress the player to the next encounter, and completing side quests will grant the player various rewards, if completed. Quests have 3 components: Quest steps, Quest giver, and Quest Reward.</p>
                 <center> <img src = "https://etrizzo.github.io/images/adventure/check_quest.PNG"></center>
                 <div align="center"> Quest.cpp: quest checks for completion every frame </div>
                 <br>
                <p>
                    The quest steps are a series of conditions, which are updated every frame. These conditions can be killing a specified actor type, collecting an item, or speaking to an actor. Every frame, the game checks if any active quest steps have been completed, and advances the quest if they have. Once all steps have been finished in a quest, the quest reward is distributed. Quest steps, called “VictoryConditions” in code, are a pure virtual class, and all of the unique quest functionalities inherit from that class. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Quest Giver is how the quest is started – now, the quest giver is either “none” (the player starts with the quest information) or an actor of a specified type. If the quest giver is an actor, the map will spawn an actor of that type on the map, and assign the quest to that actor. The player can then talk to the actor to learn more about the quest, and progress the quest.
                </p>
                  <center><img src = "https://etrizzo.github.io/images/adventure/quest_reward.PNG" align="center"></center>
                  <div align="center"> QuestReward.hpp: virtual class where different rewards inherit and implement their functionality</div>
                    <br>
                <p>
                The quest reward is a triggered once all steps in the quest have been completed. QuestReward is a pure virtual class, which individual rewards inherit from. Currently quests can award items, permanent stat increases, or party members.

                </div>
                <p>In each encounter, the player can complete a special side-quest to gain an ally in their journey. Allies spawn with a quest near villages, and send the player on lengthy missions. Once you’ve completed the quest, the ally will join your party, and fight with you. The player can swap between controlling members of their party, and can equip any member of the party with equipment. </p>
               <center><img src = "https://etrizzo.github.io/images/adventure/party_swap.png" align="center"></center>
                  <div align="center"> QuestReward.hpp: virtual class where different rewards inherit and implement their functionality</div>
                <p>In code, the player’s party is made up of a list of Actor entities, with a pointer to the current controlled actor, and an index for where that actor is in the array. Switching between party members is as simple as incrementing that index, and modding the result to loop through the list. The player’s inventory is shared across all party members – whenever an actor joins the party, their entire inventory is added to the party. This system allows for any number of actors to join the party, and easily distribute equipment as the player sees fit. Though, for gameplay purposes, the number of party members should be limited.</p>

                    Adventure is a broad game, and has lots of room to grow. I plan on continuing to work on it throughout my time at guildhall, eventually polishing it into a finished game. In the immediate feature, I'm looking to accomplish the following tasks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Save system</li>
                        <li>Melee combat</li>
                        <li>Character creation</li>
                        <li>Ally backstort generation</li>
                        <li>Timed encounters</li>
                        <li>Tutorial level</li>
                        <li>Thematic elements</li>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My final vision for adventure is a rogue-like game modeled after the "Stolen Century" arc in the popular dungeons and dragons podcast, "The Adventure Zone." In the arc, the players are pulled between parallel universes by a mysterious power, and are constantly pursued by an evil, enigmatic force hunting for that power. In Adventure, I will try to foster that sense of mystery by bringing the player into a new world in each encounter, each with its own characters and quests to explore. I believe that a stronger main arc for each encounter (i.e., timed encounters, a "homebase" for the player in each world, etc.) would add greatly to the player experience in adventure.
