                <h3>About La Rana</h3>
                <p>La Rana is a single person adventure game where the player controls Soos, a frog temple servant, who is trying to purify a cursed temple.
                </p>
                <p>
                Long ago the Temple of Rana brought rain and prosperity to the world. Now it stands neglected, its source of power stolen away. You awaken as the temple’s last guardian, a small frog spirit. The lost power of Rana lies before you at the temple’s base. Using the last drops of Rana’s power, you must explore the vast ruins while discovering its secret chambers and marveling at its faded glory. Recover the Temple of Rana’s lost power and restore rain to the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                We worked on La Rana from June to December of 2018. Because of our condensed development schedule, we decided to focus on making a tight, highly focused game with only a few polished mechanics. We played to our strengths whenever possible. With so many visually focused designers we chose to emphasize the magical, whimsical quality of the game, using visual effects to bring those qualities to life.
                </p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>
                    On La Rana, I served as the lead programmer. As a lead, I worked closely with 2 other programmers and 4 other leads to plan each sprint, coordinate with other disciplines, and be an advocate for my team in stakeholder meetings. Additionally, as the technical lead, I was responsible for project structure, builds, and ports.

<!-- Game Feature Template -->
                <h4 id="planning">Sprint Planning</h4>
                <p>At the start of each sprint, I led meetings with my team of two programmers to plan the sprint and identify any dependencies on other teams. During these meetings, it was very important to me that my team was working on things that they were interested in, or that they thought would expand their skillset, and that we avoid miscommunications with other teams, which usually result in overtime.</p>
                <h5><b>My Method: </b></h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Outline what user stories we as the programming team needed to work on for the sprint, and what the other disciplines' general goals were for the sprint.</li>
                    <li>With programming team, break down user stories into general tasks as a group.</li>
                    <li>With programming team, discuss who was most interested in which tasks, and start estimating hours and talking about dependencies. </li>
                    <li>With lead team, discuss dependencies between art, design, and programming teams, and outline a general calendar of deliverables for the sprint. </li>
                    <li>Take deliverable calendar back to programming team, to confirm that the deliverable schedule matched their expectations.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After a few sprints, it became clear that this was an effective method. Every sprint, the programmers had a general idea of what the rest of the sprint would look like from day one, which helped us to stay focused on our tasks. Additionally, when we had to change our plan due to unforseen setbacks, it was easy to move our tasks around and prioritize because we had already discussed our dependencies and priorities. The extra time that I spent on organization and communication at the start of the sprint spared us countless hours of the stress and overtime that gets caused by mid-sprint misunderstandings.

                <h4 id="negotiation">Deliverable Negotiation</h4>
                <p>As the tech lead, it was my job to determine the limits of what my team of programmers could do with the time that we had for the project. La Rana's development time spanned 6 months, working only 3 hours a day - this is a very short development window, and because we were all students with other classwork to complete, it was very important to avoid crunch at all costs.
                </p>
                <p>To accomplish this, I had to first understand each feature request as fully as I could, and make sure that my team had a say in how it would be implemented, because it's impossible to have a negotiation on a feature if I don't understand what it is or how it will be implemented. After discussing the feature with my team and learning about the subject matter, I would negotiate between the programming team, the other leads on the project, and our project stakeholders to establish what was feasible in the timeframe while still meeting stakeholder expectations. Because I found that the more informed I and my team were on the feature, the smoother our negotiations went, so as the project went on I took steps to make sure I was communicating at every step of the negotiation phase, both to my team of programmers and upwards to the other leads and stakeholders.</p>

                <h4 id="communication">Cross-discipline Communication</h4>
                <p>In any game project, it's important to have a general idea of how other disciplines are working around you. As a lead, I found that this skill was invaluable.</p>
                <p> Since entering the world of STEM, i've noticed that a lot of programmers tend to communicate in highly technical or mathematical language, which is very inaccessible to a lot of people and can easily cause rifts between team members. On La Rana, I worked closely with every person on my team at least once during the course of the project, and it was very important to me that I have a healthy and productive relationship with all of my teammates. I wanted to make sure that they understood what I was doing, and that I understood what they were doing, and I encouraged my programming team to do the same when their work impacted other team members. My role on La Rana proved to me that taking a few extra minutes to explain a system in an accessible way is invaluable - when everybody has a sense of how the pieces of the game fit togeteher, there are fewer miscommunications between teams, and everybody has more power to do what they need to do. I also found that my personal relationship with everybody on the team improved, because I was treating them with the respect they deserved.

                <p>As the technical lead on the project, it was my job to make regular builds, especially towards the end of the project, and ensure that they were stable. This included monitoring game performance, approving any risky project pushes, and tracking bugs. Early in the project, I worked with other tech leads at the guildhall to create scripts that would run each night on a designated build PC, and worked with my producer to coordinate QA testing on both the nightly build and on midday builds created on my own computer. As we began making release candidates for shipping, I was responsible for ensuring that any development tools were turned off in the build, and creating both a standalone executable and a Steam build. </p>
                <p>Along with our steam build, I also worked on ports of the game to the PlayStation 4 and Universal Windows Platform. In the end, we didn't have an avenue to publish to the PlayStation store or the Microsoft store, so we didn't dive into console-specific optimization. But the process of making builds for both PS4 and UWP was very valuable and I'm excited to take that knowledge forward to any future console ports.</p>
